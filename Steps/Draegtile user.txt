A detailed step by step overview of Draegtile Operating Systems, Draegtile programming languages and module creation and real-time applications through upgrading the python programming language as an embedded coding language and programming language for Software and hardware system creation and upgrade but this specific Draegtile language serves as a standalone module that integrates ,incorporates and imbeds all programming languages ,real-time and spatial data ,language and number systems through magnetic and solar data sensors, devices and systems ,user interaction ,machine data , AI data and all education systems in one frequency wave and signature for optimal and efficient use. Draegtile, Draegtile OS and Hardware Systems would start out as a singular standalone unit/Application and the user interaction it grows to your suited needs unless of course you are trying termination and execution commands for graphical and such data it will end sequence ,blacklist and report user, also creating a log ,identifying user real-time data. Also creating an alert for such ex-users with detailed investigative constant visible loop of their live real-time data ,visual data (Cameras, Sketches, photos, last seen or known location., audio data of them, Personal I.D data and related info)For safety of other uses, and none users. 

the core safety module which also imbeds emoji and special characters for a proper os, bios and user interface of Draegtile and proper dimensional data processing. REMEMBER THE OS,SOFTWARE, BIOS AND ANY DIGITAL BUILD RUNS AS ONE TRUE MODULE, WHERE BIOS 1ST, OS 2ND , 3RD DRAEGTILE SOFTWARE APPLICATION BUIILDS (.DSAB files) ,4TH DIGITAL BUILDS (.DB files) ,5TH DIGITAL APPLICATION BUILDS, 6TH DIGITAL APPLICATION PROCESSES (.DAB AND .DAP files) AND 7TH MODULE AS DRAEGTILE EXTENSIONS (.DE)
