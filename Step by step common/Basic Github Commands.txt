GitHub commands that can be used in the terminal to manage your repositories, including changing their visibility to private or public remotely from any device. This can be achieved using GitHub's REST API or GitHub CLI (gh), which is a tool for interacting with GitHub directly from the terminal.

Prerequisites
GitHub CLI Installation: Ensure that you have the GitHub CLI installed on your system.

To install GitHub CLI, follow the installation guide here.
Authenticate GitHub CLI: After installing the CLI, authenticate it with your GitHub account by running the command:

bash
Copy code
gh auth login
GitHub API Token: You can also interact with GitHub's REST API using Personal Access Tokens for authentication if you prefer using curl or http requests directly in your terminal.

Step-by-Step Guide Using GitHub CLI (gh)
1. Change Repository Visibility to Private
To change the visibility of a repository to private using the terminal, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
gh repo edit <username>/<repository-name> --visibility private
For example:

bash
Copy code
gh repo edit Rb9906/my-repo --visibility private
This will make the repository my-repo private.

2. Change Repository Visibility to Public
To change a repository's visibility to public:

bash
Copy code
gh repo edit <username>/<repository-name> --visibility public
For example:

bash
Copy code
gh repo edit Rb9906/my-repo --visibility public
3. Make All Repositories Private or Public in Bulk
You can loop through all your repositories and make them private or public using a simple script in the terminal.

Example for making all repositories private:
bash
Copy code
for repo in $(gh repo list <username> --limit 100 --json name --jq '.[].name'); do
  gh repo edit <username>/$repo --visibility private
done
Replace <username> with your GitHub username. This script loops through all repositories and makes them private.

Example for making all repositories public:
bash
Copy code
for repo in $(gh repo list <username> --limit 100 --json name --jq '.[].name'); do
  gh repo edit <username>/$repo --visibility public
done
This will make all your repositories public.

Step-by-Step Guide Using GitHub REST API (curl)
You can also use GitHub REST API to change repository visibility. Hereâ€™s how you can do it using curl in your terminal.

1. Change Repository to Private
bash
Copy code
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/<username>/<repository-name> \
  -d '{"private": true}'
2. Change Repository to Public
bash
Copy code
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/<username>/<repository-name> \
  -d '{"private": false}'
Replace:

YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN with your Personal Access Token.
<username> with your GitHub username.
<repository-name> with the name of the repository you wish to update.
Other Useful GitHub CLI Commands for Editing and Development
Here are some additional useful commands for development and editing repositories through the GitHub CLI:

1. Clone a Repository
bash
Copy code
gh repo clone <username>/<repository-name>
2. Create a New Repository
bash
Copy code
gh repo create <repository-name> --public
or for private:

bash
Copy code
gh repo create <repository-name> --private
3. List All Repositories
To list all your repositories:

bash
Copy code
gh repo list <username>
4. Fork a Repository
bash
Copy code
gh repo fork <repository-url>
5. Create a Pull Request
bash
Copy code
gh pr create --fill
6. Merge a Pull Request
bash
Copy code
gh pr merge <pr-number>
7. View Issues
To view issues for a repository:

bash
Copy code
gh issue list
8. Edit Repository Description
bash
Copy code
gh repo edit <username>/<repository-name> --description "New description"
9. Add Collaborators
bash
Copy code
gh repo edit <username>/<repository-name> --add-collaborator <collaborator-username>
10. Delete a Repository
bash
Copy code
gh repo delete <username>/<repository-name>
Conclusion
Using GitHub CLI and GitHub REST API, you can easily automate tasks such as making repositories private or public, editing repository settings, and managing repositories remotely. These tools provide flexibility for real-time development and integration with your existing projects.

To make an existing repository private using GitHub Desktop and the GitHub website, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the GitHub Website
Open a browser and go to the GitHub website.
Log in to your GitHub account.
Step 2: Navigate to Your Repository
Once logged in, go to your profile by clicking on your profile icon (top right).
In your profile, click on the Repositories tab to see a list of all your repositories.
Click on the name of the repository that you want to make private.
Step 3: Access Repository Settings
On your repository's page, click on the Settings tab (located near the top of the repository's page).
Step 4: Change Repository Visibility
Scroll down to the Danger Zone section, near the bottom of the Settings page.
Look for the option labeled Change repository visibility.
Click the Change visibility button.
A pop-up will appear. Select Make private.
Confirm your choice by typing the repository name and clicking I understand, make this repository private.
Note: Once a repository is made private, only collaborators and people with access to the repository will be able to view and contribute.

Step 5: Verify Changes in GitHub Desktop
Open GitHub Desktop.
Sync your repository with the remote by clicking Fetch origin or Pull origin from the top bar.
You should see the repository status as private in your GitHub Desktop client.
By following these steps, your repository will be made private, restricting its visibility to only you and your collaborators.
