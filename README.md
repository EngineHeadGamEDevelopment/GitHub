Simple Weather AI App - Patch 1

Overview

The Simple Weather AI App is an Android application that provides real-time weather information using AI to fetch and display data based on the user's location. This patch focuses on optimizing the app's AI capabilities, resolving issues with fetching weather data, and enhancing the UI/UX for a smoother user experience.

Patch 1 Features

Real-time weather data based on user location.

Improved data fetching and error handling for weather information.

Enhanced UI for better visibility of weather updates.

Optimized AI model for weather predictions.

Bug fixes for API connectivity.


Requirements

Android Studio (latest version recommended)

Java JDK 8 or higher

Gradle (compatible version)

TensorFlow Lite (for AI model handling)

Weather API Key (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

Internet connection (for real-time data fetching)

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rb9906/SimpleWeatherAIApp.git


2. Open the project in Android Studio:

Launch Android Studio.

Click on Open an existing Android Studio project.

Navigate to the SimpleWeatherAIApp directory and select it.



3. Sync Gradle:

Allow Android Studio to sync and download the necessary dependencies.

Make sure all dependencies are resolved without errors.



4. Add Weather API Key:

Get your API key from OpenWeatherMap.

Add your key to the strings.xml file:

<string name="weather_api_key">YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>




Building and Running

1. Connect your Android device or start an Android emulator.


2. Click the Run button in Android Studio or use the following command:

./gradlew assembleDebug


3. Install the APK on your device or emulator:

./gradlew installDebug


4. Launch the App and test the weather data fetching based on your location.



Usage

1. Launch the app.


2. Allow location permissions for real-time weather updates.


3. View the weather information on the main screen.


4. If weather data fails to load, check the internet connection or API key.



Code Breakdown

MainActivity.java

Handles the app's primary interface, user interactions, and triggers data fetching from WeatherService.

WeatherService.java

Manages API calls, fetching weather data, and parsing responses. Integrates AI predictions using AIWeatherModel.

WeatherData.java

A model class for handling weather-related data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

AIWeatherModel.java

Contains AI-based predictions for weather conditions using TensorFlow Lite model (ai_weather_model.tflite).

Future Improvements

Add more AI-based predictions for localized weather events.

Implement offline caching of weather data.

Improve UI to display weather trends over time.

Add support for multiple weather APIs.
